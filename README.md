Goal:

A page of content from each member.  We can get on a Zoom call at some
point to divide it up.  It has to be 4 - 5 pages, but in the past they have
been upwards of 13.

I also kind of expect that some people may feel like they can contribute more
than others because they have chosen to cover something that is easier to find
info on and etc so it is not a strict requirement.

Illustrations are also allowed. Examples of completed notes are on Canvas 
under the files tab.
