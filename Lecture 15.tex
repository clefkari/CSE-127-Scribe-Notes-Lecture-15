\section{Common Crytographic Network Protocols}

\subsection{TLS (Transport Layer Security)}
TLS (Transport Layer Security), originally called the Secure Socket Layer (SSL),
is used to provide an encryption wrapper around HTTP to make HTTPS.  TLS is 
wrapped around the application layer so it is often utilized when securing many
other application layer protocols.  

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt The main security goals of TLS are to: authenticate the server,
ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the traffic, and to ensure that the
client is infact connected to the server which they think they are connected to.}

\subsection{SSH (Secure Shell)}
SSH is a modern day alternative to the antequated Telnet.  Telnet was phased out
by the more secure SSH due to security reasons as Telnet uses an unencrypted 
connection that sends information in plaintext, which is easily exploitable.

\bigskip
{\parindent0ptIn terms of the security benefits that SSH provides, SSH 
authenticates both server and client, and ensures the confidentiality and 
integrity of the traffic, between server and client.}

\subsection{IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)}
IPsec is an encrpyted and authenticated alternative to IP.  It is a complicated
set of protocols which attempt to replace the IP layer.  Regular IP is an
insecure solution because the packets which travel that layer are unencrypted.
IPSec is a common solution in VPN (Virtual Private Network) services.

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt IPSec's security goals are client and server authentication, the
authentication of headers and option to encrypt headers, and ensuring the
confidentiality and integrity of payloads.}

\section{Constructing a Secure Encrypted Channel}
In order to construct a securely encrypted channel, several preliminary
steps (not by order) must be performed:

\subsection{Encryption and MAC (Message Authentication Code)}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{./tls1.png}
\end{center}

{\parindent0pt Alice (left) and Bob (right) want to communicate on a secure 
channel that is protected against passive eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle
attacks.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Assuming Alice and Bob have shared a set of keys, Alice sends her
AES ciphertext and the MAC of the ciphertext to Bob.  Bob can now check the MAC
and decrypt the cipher text to get the original message.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt The MAC is a short string of data which authenticates the message, i.e. it
confirms that the message was sent by the true sender and was not modified in transit.}

\subsection{Diffie-Hellman key exchange}
In order to negotiate charing encryption and MAC keys, there must be a
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{./tls2.png}
\end{center}

{\parindent0pt \textbf{Note:} In the image above $g^{a}$  should be read as 
$g^{a}\ mod\ p$ and likewise $g^{b}$ should be read $g^{b}\ mod\ p$}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt If a Diffie-Hellman key exchange has occurred then both Alice 
and Bob will have a \textbf{shared secret}. In this case Alice and Bob's shared
secret is $g^{ab}$.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Using this shared secret Bob and Alice can use a Key Derivation
Function (KDF), 
\smallskip
$k_e, k_m\ =\ KDF(g^{ab})$, which we can think of as a hash function that is 
used to create encryption and MAC keys they can use for symmetric cryptography.}

\subsection{Ensure Authenticity of Endpoints}
{\parindent0pt There is a vulnerabiliy with this approach because if there is 
an active man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker can intercept the Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.  To ensure the authenticity of the endpoint we must use
\textbf{digital signatures}, to prevent man-in-the-middle interference of the
key exchange.
You can have either one or both parties sign the key exchange with a long-term
public key.}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{./tls3.png}
\end{center}

{\parindent0pt For example, assume that Alice is the client (web browser), Bob 
is the web server, Alice knows the server's long-term key, and Alice is trying 
to communicate with Bob.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt To protect the Diffie-Hellman key exchange Bob will sign the key
exchange with his long-term key.  Since Alice knows both Bob's original long 
term-key and the signature which Bob has given Alice, she can verify the 
signature by using Bob's public key before progressing with the encryption.}

\subsection{Trusting Signatures}
{\parindent0pt While we may now be protected against man-in-the-middle attacks 
targeted towards the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we have still not verified 
the integrity of Bob's public signing key which Alice has received.}

\includegraphics[scale=.7]{./tls4.png}

{\parindent0pt The public signing key that Bob sends to Alice is susceptible to
active man-in-the-middle attacks, so we must determine a way to trust the keys 
that the client receives.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Assuming that there is a man-in-the-middle who is intercepting 
all of the communications between Alice and Bob, an attacker can substitute 
Bob's public key with their own generated public key and Alice would not be 
able to tell the difference.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Due to the nature of this attack, we must have an 
\textbf{external} method of establishing trust in keys.}

\subsection{Establishing Trust in Keys}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt \textbf{Meet in person to exchange keys.}}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt This is the simplest way, however this is not practical at scale
over the internet}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt \textbf{Fingerprint Verification}}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt Fingerprint verification is a methodology that follows the TOFO 
(Trust On First Use) paradigm of verifying the cryptographic hash of a public 
key through a seperate channel.  It is sometimes used to secure SSH host keys. 
A benefit of this method is that you can trust the fingerprint forever as long 
as you dont believe that the connection was man-in-the-middle attack during the
first connection.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt \textbf{Hard Code Public Keys in Software}}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt Otherwise known as "Certificate pinning" this method is used by
web browsers to protect against attacks from malicious sites.  Pinned
certificates are usually keys baked into software.  To figure out which
certificates to trust there are 'certificate authorities' whom act as a
commercial trusted intermediary that verfiy public keys and sign them in
exchange for money.  If you trust the certificate authority then you must also
trust the keys they sign.  You do not need to worry about these certificate
authorities decrypting your traffic because all they know you are doing is
signing the public key, they have no idea of the private key used.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt \textbf{Web of Trust}}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt If you do not like the premise of trusting large commerical companies with
profit in mind you can instead choose to create a Web of Trust. This is done  by
trusting your friends, and in turn trusting anyone who has had their public key
signed by one of your friends so you can indirectly trust others through your
friends.  This method of establishing trust is used by PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy), an open source email encryption software written in the
early 1990s.}

\bigskip

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{./Trust-in-keys2.png}
\end{center}
  
  
\subsection{Using RNG in Signature}

Returning our discussion to the secure channel: assume Alice knows to trust a 
key because it has a certificate authority signature or it is baked into our 
software. Now Alice and Bob are able to negotiate a fresh shared session key and
encrypt all of their messages using symmetric crypto which will be secure 
against an active man in the middle and a passive eavesdropper.

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt One final detail: in order to protect against an adversary from
replaying a signature (reusing it across multiple handshakes), you might include
some extra randomness, for example a nonce, a value that you use once. It 
doesn't necessarily have to be cryptographically strong, but it has to be 
unpredictable to the adversary. The signature is over these randomly chosen 
values so should be different every time the protocol runs, so adversaries can't
steal the signature from a previous protocol.}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./Trust-in-keys3.png}

Keep in mind that the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is subject to a man in the 
middle attack. Therefore you need to use digital signatures, because you need 
to know where to get your trust from the public key that is signed, so you need
a public key infrastructure. Once you've done that, then you can trust that 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange hasn't been man in the middle. Then you derive 
symmetric session keys and then use symmetric crypto to encrypt the content.

\section{TLS: Transport Layer Security}

\subsection{TLS Overview}
TLS was called SSL in the 1990s. It provides an encrypted channel for 
application data. It's used for HTTPS (HTTP inside of a TLS session). Keep in 
mind that the content that's being sent, like the symmetrically encrypted 
messages, once negotiation is done, is like the HTTP connection. There are 
several protocol versions which are not numbered sequentially.  Academic papers
show that maintaining support for old versions of the protocol lead to bad 
downgrade and decryption attacks.

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt SSL 1.0 Terribly insecure; never released.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt SSL 2.0 Released in 1995; terribly insecure,deprecated in 2011.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt SSL 3.0  Released in 1996; terribly insecure,deprecated in 2015.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt TLS 1.0 Released in 1999; deprecated in 2020.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt TLS 1.1 Released in 2006; deprecated in 2020.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt TLS 1.2 Released in 2008. Ok.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt TLS 1.3 Standardized in August 2018 and is being rolled out now;
major change from TLS 1.2 .}

\bigskip
TLS 1.1, 1.2,  and 1.3 are similar, but in general TLS 1.3 is a better protocol.
Older versions of TLS have potential flaws.

\subsection{TLS 1.2 with Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange}

\subsubsection{Step 1-4}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.54\linewidth]{./DiffieStep1.png} 
  \includegraphics[width=.54\linewidth]{./DiffieStep2.png}
  \includegraphics[width=.54\linewidth]{./DiffieStep3.png} 
  \includegraphics[width=.54\linewidth]{./DiffieStep4.png}
\end{center}

\noindent The server will sign its part of the key exchange, shown as 
$Sign_{RSAkey}(p,g,g^a)$ in the image above. Since the message is signed by 
the server's RSA key, which is signed by a certificate authority that Alice 
trusts, it cannot be modified by a man-in-the-middle attack.

\subsubsection{Step 5}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.8]{./DiffieStep5.png}
\end{center}

\noindent This message is usually not authenticated since user authentication is not 
commonly done at the cryptographic layer when using the web.

\subsubsection{Step 6}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.8]{./DiffieStep6.png}
\end{center}

\noindent $KDF$ is the key derivation function,
$k_{m_c}$, $k_{m_s}$, and $k_{e}$ are the symmetric keys,
$k_{m_c}$ is the client's MAC key, $k_{m_s}$ is the server's MAC key and $k_{e}$ 
is the encryption key.

\subsubsection{Step 7}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.8]{./DiffieStep7.png}
\end{center}

\noindent They can verify the integrity of the handshake by each sending a MAC (Message 
Authentication Code) of all of the messages they have sent so far using the 
symmetric keys that they derived in the last step. This guarantees that the channel is secure.

\subsubsection{Step 8}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.8]{./DiffieStep8.png}
\end{center}

\noindent For example, Alice (client) will make an HTTP GET request for index.html over 
the encrypted channel.

\subsection{Certificates and Certificate Authorities in TLS}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \textbf{Sample Certificate}\par\medskip
    \includegraphics[scale=.4]{./cert1.png}
    \caption{an example of a valid certificate from cse.ucsd.edu}
\end{figure}

\smallskip
\noindent The certificate authority (CA) is InCommon RSA Server CA.

\smallskip
\noindent The domain name for which this certificate is meant is 
cse.ucsd.edu, with multiple DNS names listed

\smallskip
\noindent The public key uses RSA Encryption, with exponent 65537, N = 2048,
and the public key and signature are both view able to the user.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \textbf{Sample Certificate Cont.}\par\medskip
    \includegraphics[scale=.5]{./cert2.png}
    \caption{This part of the certificate tells the user where to look for 
    revocation information}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Revocation}
It's possible for a key to be compromised, ie for an attacker to obtain a 
private key. This is clearly undesirable, as any private/encrypted messages 
sent to whomever owns this private key can now be read by the attacker, and/or 
the attacker can sign any messages he wants as if he were the original owner of
the private key. In the case that a Certificate Authority key is compromised, a
client may receive a perfectly valid certificate that was signed by an attacker,
and there would be no way of knowing this certificate is invalid unless the CA 
announced that their public key is no longer valid.

\bigskip
Therefore, there exists a revocation process for public keys. If Alice, for 
example, finds out that her private key has been compromised, she is able to 
announce or allow her senders to find out that her public key is no longer valid
and they should not be using that public key to encrypt messages to her anymore.
This verification must be signed by the private key, as you wouldn't want anyone
else to arbitrarily cancel your key. Both CA and PGP PKIs support this. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \textbf{Compromised Certificate: Man in the Middle}
    \includegraphics[scale=.4]{./cert3.png}
    \caption{Man-in-the-middle attack using rogue certificate}

\end{figure}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt The attacker has managed to obtain valid certificates from a CA 
trusted by the client.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt This allows the attacker to intercept the data being sent from the
bank, and send the client his own "certified and trusted" public key as if 
he were the bank; the client will accept this, (since it has the valid 
certificate) encrypt her data using this malicious key, and send the 
data to the bank.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt This gives the attacker free reign to proxy any and all traffic 
to and from the client and the bank, modifying any data as he pleases, 
as he can decrypt whatever the client was sending to the bank.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt One could imagine the attacker modifying the client request to say
something along the lines of "transfer all the money to the attacker 
account." }


\subsection {CA Hacks / Vulnerabilities}
{\parindent0pt \textbf{There is a long history of CAs getting hacked or 
certifying wrong things.}}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 2011: Comodo + DigiNotar hacked to issue fraudulent certificates
for Hotmail, Gmail, Skype, Yahoo Mail, Firefox}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 2013: TurkTrust issued fraudulent certificate for Gmail}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 2014: Indian NIC issue certs for Google and Yahoo!}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 2016: WoSign issues cert for GitHub.}

\paragraph{Mitigations}
\subparagraph {Certificate pinning:} Limits risk by restricting which 
certificates are considered valid for a particular website. Instead of allowing
any CA in the trusted list to sign a certificate, the browser pins the CA of 
choice; any certificates received that are not from this pinned CA are 
considered invalid. Therefore, attackers are unable to man in the middle even 
if they have a valid certificate from a trusted authority as long as the pinned
authority doesn't match.
\subparagraph {Certificate Transparency:} All certificates are publicly 
disclosed, providing greater insight and transparency. Certificate transparency 
has two main components, logs and monitors.

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Logs maintain records of all issued certificates to a domain. 
These logs are append only, and cannot be altered or deleted once a certificate
has been added to the log (using something called a Merkle Tree to achieve
this)}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Monitors do just that, monitor the logs for anything they can be
set to monitor. Some monitors can allow users to create and run queries for 
certificates, as google does. Some domains may be interested in receiving 
notifications for when a certificate is issued to their domain, or if it matches
some query they are interested in monitoring.}

\subsection{TLS 1.2 with RSA Key Exchange}
Another way to negotiate keys in TLS 1.2 is using RSA public key encryption to 
share a secret master key.

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt 1) This starts with the Alice[client] sending a hello.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 2) Then, the server will send over its certificate, which 
contains its public key.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 3) Alice[client] will choose a random value, called a premaster 
secret, which she encrypts to the server's RSA public key and sends back to the 
server.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 4) The server is the only one who can decrypt the value of the 
encrypted premaster secret.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 5) The server and client will then use a key derivation function 
to derive their encryption and MAC keys.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 6) The server and client will exchange MACs of the dialogue.}

\smallskip
{\parindent0pt 7) Finally, they will send encrypted requests using the symmetric 
encryption key.}

\includegraphics[scale=.6]{./TLS_RSA.png}

The only difference from using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is the client 
instead encrypts a secret and sends it to the server.

\subsection{How TLS Achieves Its Security Goals}
{\parindent0pt It allows transmitting information between a client and the 
server with an encrypted connection. Listening in, only allows the recipients 
who are exchanging information to be seen. Without the secret keys the 
information cannot be decrypted.}

\subsection{What If a Private Key Gets Stolen or Compromised?}
{\parindent0pt The attacker is able to actively man-in-the-middle a connection.
Therefore, they are able to impersonate the server to others. This allows the 
attacker to eavesdrop between the parties. With the a valid secret key they are
able to decrypt messages that are being sent from the users compromised key.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt With a compromised RSA key, the attacker can obtain the session
keys and decrypt the sessions information. Any past traffic that is recorded 
can also be decrypted with such an attack.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Allowing handshake encryption immediately after key exchange. 
This limits the amount of data that an eavesdropper can see. Also a noticeable 
slower time to secure a connection.}

\subsection{TLS Keytheft and Other Risks in the Wild}
{\parindent0pt If an attacker was able to issue validated certificates for a 
domain they don’t own, then they wouldn’t need to get a hold of any existing 
private keys. They would just make their own key pair and issue a certificates 
for it. The attacker DoS’s the victim’s server and stands their own server up 
using the attacker’s certificate and key.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt However, if an attacker gets the private key for a victim’s 
server then the attacker does not need to create a new certificate. The attacker
will just grab the existing cert (it’s already being handed out by the victim’s
server) and use it to decrypt or man in the middle connections or impersonate the server.}

\bigskip
{\parindent0pt Often an ordinary user is vulnerable to one or more parties that 
they don't really trust, between them and any particular peer out on the 
Internet, this might be the proprietor of the coffee shop where they're using 
WiFi, or their home ISP, the network engineers at their employer's place of 
business, or even the sovereign government of the country they're in.}

\subsection{U.S. Government}
{\parindent0pt The US government has actually 
weakened encryption to make their job of spying easier. For example, in the 
1990s, TLS 1.0 included options to weaken the protocol for US export control 
(browsers outside of the US were to request the weakened option). Even though 
these options are no longer required due to political shifts, there are still 
servers that respect the request. This lead to a series of attacks such as 
FREAK, logjam, and DROWN.}
